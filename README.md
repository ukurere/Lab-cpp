## README
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Yevgieniia and now I'm a student, and this repository is where I'll be storing my lab assignments and practice exercises in C++. Itâ€™s a place to keep track of my progress, explore new programming concepts, and refine my skills. Feel free to browse the code and share any feedback!
